76,"Barker, Jane",Bosvil and Galesia,1713,,b,f,1719_Bosvil and Galesia.txt,"""""Bosvil and Galesia"""" is a novel by Jane Barker that tells the story of two young lovers, Bosvil and Galesia, who are separated by their families' feud. Bosvil, the son of a wealthy landowner, falls in love with Galesia, the daughter of a poor farmer. Despite their differences in social status, the two are determined to be together. However, their families' animosity towards each other proves to be a major obstacle to their love.As the story unfolds, Bosvil and Galesia must navigate their way through a series of challenges and obstacles, including jealous suitors, family pressure, and societal expectations. Along the way, they encounter a cast of intriguing characters, including a cunning lawyer, a wise old woman, and a group of traveling actors.Despite the many obstacles they face, Bosvil and Galesia remain committed to each other, and their love ultimately triumphs over the feud that has divided their families for generations. """"Bosvil and Galesia"""" is a timeless tale of love, loyalty, and perseverance, set against the backdrop of 17th century England.Now as Pride agitated my Thoughts in regard of Bosvil, so did Revenge a little in regard of Brafort; for I pleas'd my self to think how he would be balk'd, who I thought had been very remiss in his Devoirs towards such a Goddess, as the World's Flatterers had made of me.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations.
